# InventorySystem_Unity
A simple inventory system made in Unity, as part of an evaluation test of seven days to assess my programming skills. This test was the first step of a job interview for a position of Junior Unity Developer. Everything in this repo was produced in roughly 30 hours of work (from 2025/04/10 to 2025/04/16), as shown in the .xlsx file.
